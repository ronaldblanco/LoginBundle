This old bundles are for Symfony2.
The only thing you need to do if want to try it is make it run as a bundle in your symfony project.

The SshBundle was made for execute a command in the server (linux) were you are opening the proyect or other you want. The idea is basically, take the command, execute it through ssh in the desired server, and received back a text file with the result. Result that will be show on the web for you.
